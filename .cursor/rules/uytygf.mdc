title: "Improve Customer Satisfaction with AI and Complaint Analysis"

event_dates: "11 - 13 December 2025"

context: >
Algérie Télécom receives thousands of customer comments every day from multiple channels:
social media (Facebook, Twitter, ...) and the call center. These messages contain valuable
signals about satisfaction, outages, suggestions and delays, but their volume and diversity
make manual analysis impossible. This hackathon aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence
to automate and optimize the handling of these complaints.

objectives:

"Analyze and classify customer comments by type and urgency."

"Help support and communications teams prioritize critical complaints."

"Provide real-time indicators and visualizations of satisfaction trends."

competition_structure:

"The hackathon includes two distinct challenges, corresponding to the two main sources of customer data."

"Challenge 1 — Social Media Comments Classification:"

" • Data source: comments extracted from social media (Facebook, Twitter...)."

" • Total volume: ~30,000 comments."

" • CSV format: columns «comment», «platform», «class»."

"Challenge 2 — Call Center Tickets Classification:"

" • Data source: complaint tickets recorded via the call center management system."

" • CSV format: structured data with column «class_int»."

" • Number of classes: 6."

" • Call center ticket fields include: ticket ID (SNHandle), date/time (timeTT), status, processing department, service type, subscription level, service content, technical/commercial type, technology (ADSL/FTTH/4G), and location (Wilaya/ACTEL)."

participation:

"Team composition: 5 members per team."

"Each team must designate a team leader as the contact point."

"All teams must join the competitions on Kaggle and add all their members to a single team at the start of the hackathon."

kaggle_competitions:

"Two separate Kaggle competitions:"

" • Competition 1: Social media comments classification (9 classes)."

" • Competition 2: Call center tickets classification (6 classes)."

"Evaluation metric: Macro F1-Score."

"Important: Teams must participate in both competitions. The final ranking will be based on the average of the F1-scores obtained on the two challenges."

required_submissions:

"Submit via the official Google Form:"

" 1. Full source code (Model + Inference code) — Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, etc. — Mandatory."

" 2. Technical report describing methodology, models used, and results — Mandatory."

" 3. Presentation slides for the defense — Optional."

selection_and_evaluation:

"Phase 1 — Kaggle competitions (Quantitative):"

" • Teams submit predictions on Kaggle for both challenges."

" • The final score is the arithmetic mean of the accuracies of the two competitions."

" • The top 10 teams by this average score are selected for the final phase."

"Phase 2 — Jury presentation (Qualitative):"

" • The 10 finalist teams present their solution to a panel of experts."

" • Presentation duration: 10 minutes per team (including Q&A)."

" • The jury selects the top 3 winning teams based on the criteria below."

jury_evaluation_criteria:

"1. Model accuracy and performance — accuracy, robustness, generalization."

"2. Methodology and technical approach — algorithm choice, preprocessing, validation."

"3. Innovation and originality — creativity of the proposed solution."

"4. Relevance and business impact — applicability for Algérie Télécom."

"5. Presentation quality — clarity, design, persuasiveness."

suggested_innovation_tracks:

"1. Intelligent multi-modal classification: develop a unified AI model capable of handling both data types."

"2. Analytical dashboard: visualize customer satisfaction and urgencies in real time."

"3. Trend analysis: identify dominant topics and anticipate dissatisfaction."

"4. Automatic urgency detection: automatically prioritize critical complaints."

"5.Dialectal NLP: adapt models to users' specific language (Darija, mixed Arabic-French)."

resources_and_support:

"Datasets will be provided in CSV format via the Kaggle competitions."

"Documentation and data examples available on Day 1."

"Mentors and experts available to support teams."
