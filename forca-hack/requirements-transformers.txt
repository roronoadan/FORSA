# Optional (only needed for `train_social_transformer.py`)
#
# IMPORTANT (Colab/Kaggle):
# - PyTorch is already installed (with CUDA when you enable GPU).
# - Installing `torch` via pip often pulls a CPU-only wheel and disables GPU.
# So we intentionally DO NOT pin/install torch here.
#
# If you run locally, install the correct torch build separately.
